## Introduction

This project is a 12.5u WKL main cluster + macro column 40% keyboard that was created to accomplish two goals:
- Learn about STM32 microprocessors.
- Practice trace routing with curved traces.

## Features
This PCB features the following:
- Powered by an STM32F072 microprocessor.
- Traditional overcharge, overcurrent and ESD protection.
- RGB LED lightbard between the macro column and 12.5u main cluster.
- Maximum of 4 rotary encoders on the macro column.

The case is a standard stacked acrylic case cut from 1.6mm sheets. The intent is to use adhere poron strips to the back of the switch plate and sandwich it between the acrylic layers above and below. However, any foam-like material would probably suffice. 



## Production
Please note that the production files were prepared with JLCPCB's SMT assembly in mind. Should you deicide to proceed with a different manufacturer, the Bill of Materials (BOM) and position files may need to be modified.
