## Introduction

This project is a 12.5u WKL main cluster + macro column 40% keyboard that was created to accomplish two goals:
- Learn about STM32 microprocessors.
- Practice trace routing with curved traces.


## Features
This PCB features the following:
- Powered by an STM32F072 microprocessor.
- Traditional overcharge, overcurrent and ESD protection.
- RGB LED lightbard between the macro column and 12.5u main cluster.
- Maximum of 4 rotary encoders on the macro column.



## Production
Please note that the produection files were prepared with JLCPCB's SMT assembly in mind. Should you deicide to proceed with a different manufacturer, the Bill of Materials (BOM) and position files may need to be modified.
